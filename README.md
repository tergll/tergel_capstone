# Yurt of ML â€“ Visuals for Educational Videos

This repository contains the code used to generate visualizations for my YouTube channel, Yurt of ML. The goal of the channel is to make machine-learning concepts more accessible and visually engaging through simple, clear animations.

## Structure
The folder "decision tree" contains all videos generated by the Manim library for the video:

Other folders besides "decision trees" contain the most important unique visualizations from the corresponding videos found on the channel: https://www.youtube.com/@ML_ger

Each file is a separate scene that will output an MP4 file video.
